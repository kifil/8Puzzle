# 8Puzzle

This is an algorithmic solution for solving for solving the fifteen puzzle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle 

The solution uses a priority queue and the A-star pathfinding algorithim to determine which board should be tested next. 

The application follows the specs listed here: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/8puzzle.html 

The applicaiton requires an external library to be run which can be located here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar Or on the Algorithims book site here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
